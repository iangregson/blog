A Time to Feel Fortunate
========================

I was inspired to write this post by episode 2 of [Grayson’s Art Club](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/graysons-art-club). Grayson remarks on how creative practice can help us deal with this strange time of lockdown and isolation.

> “creativity: it’s a way of dealing with what’s going on in your life”.

I agree with this. Being able to go make stuff every day - to make something from nothing or pull something apart and improve it with my mind and my hands - is a privilege I cherish and I know deep down that it has a positive effect on my overall wellbeing.

I don’t know _why_ that is. There’s probably not a reason we can put in words. But Grayson offers a very perceptive observation:

> “it operates on a level we don’t always access easily in our day to day relationships or in our language”

The show features artist Maggi Hambling who describes how she starts the day by making a drawing. She goes on to recognise that this creative practice is a remedy.

> “I go bit pottier that ever if, for some reason, if I don’t do it every day. Of course, it’s therapy - we’re lucky.”

In the context of the quote, Maggi refers directly to her and Grayson and more broadly to artists in general. I want to extend that. I want to include us software engineers in the lucky group. We have our own creative practice that can be a remedy. Like Maggi making her drawing, I feel renewed when I open the IDE or text editor. Or when playing an [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle. Or when fixing that last bug. 

These are simple things yet they make a massive contribution to quality of life for me and my family. I wanted to take a moment to be mindful that I am fortunate.

If anyone reads this, I hope you’re safe and well. If you’re feeling the weight of lockdown and self-isolation get you down, I offer a repeat of Maggi’s advice,

> “go to your work and have a conversation with it”.

That conversation, and the creative activities it spurs, seem to help me greatly.
