Talking About Ideas
===================

I was inspired to start writing this by a talk from John Carmack. It was given some years ago at Facebook but was recently made available on YouTube. He is brilliant as always.

He is talking about generating ideas. It struck me that the process he describes is not specific to software engineering, or to computer science, or even to engineering or science more broadly. I think the process he describes is a cornerstone of all creative endeavours - it is an essential part of our Creative Practice. And this is something I know a little about.

### An impostor

That’s me. My academic background is in the arts but my job title says engineer. I am lucky enough to work with a great team who make me feel equal and I’ve worked hard to give myself a CS education through great resources like [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t), Udemy, edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, [Stanford Online](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/cs161-design-and-analysis-algorithms) and [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). But I’ve never dared to write about software engineering because there are plenty of more qualified people who can do that much better than me.

### Context is important

Hearing John Carmack talk at length about “anti-fragile idea generation” in the aforementioned YouTube clip gave me a new perspective. I thought, here is one of the best and most respected software engineers in the world meditating on a subject that I’ve studied in depth[1]. If I can’t talk arbitrarily about software engineering with any confidence or conviction, maybe I can set the context more specifically to find the courage.

And so, here I am at the beginning of a journey into writing down my thoughts. I’m going to talk about software engineering through the lens of creative practice and talk about creative practice through the lens of software engineering. Hopefully, along the way, I’ll get better at both.

If you want to join me you are most welcome. I have no idea how frequently I’ll write. I have no idea what specific area/technology/themes I’ll cover. I only know, in the broadest sense, that I’ll talk about ideas and how we make things (mainly software things) from them.

I guess we can have some fun with that, right?

1. I will try to unpack that statement next time.
