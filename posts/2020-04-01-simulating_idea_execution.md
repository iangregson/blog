Simulating Idea Execution
=========================

In the last post, I talked about how [John Carmack’s thinking on “anti-fragile” ideas](https://youtu.be/dSCBCk4xVa0) inspired me to start writing about creative practice in software engineering. In this post, I’m going to try to explain why.

To me, what Carmack is describing is the process of simulating an idea in my head. Instead of immediately going to the terminal and starting to type in code, I think about the idea and how it interacts with its context. I’m taking the idea and playing it through a bunch of scenarios to see if it stays whole or begins to break apart. And this play is an essential part of any creative practice.

Think about how a chef creates a recipe from an idea. At some point, chef will take the ingredients into a kitchen and produce some version of that idea to physically taste. But before that, she’ll consider the balance of these ingredients in her head.

Think about how a musician records a song. At some point, she’ll describe the notes to the musicians who will perform the song, but before that she’s already heard the harmony and timbre inside her head.

To bring these examples back into the “anti-fragile” terms, we can say that if chef didn’t simulate the interactions of her ingredients well enough, the chances of resulting recipe being great are much lower. Similarly, the less consideration the musician gave to her musical ideas, the lower the chances are of the song working out when she and the musicians are in the studio. We could say that these compositions were fragile.
